Advanced Combo Logic TL;DR.

Unmounted | Kled Form
- Use Q to get away while walking away from the enemy (Determined by the fact if you're walking away from them)
- Use Q to get Skaarl (If Resource = 90 will use Q to get the last 10 points, ignores other logic)
- Use Q as a gapcloser (While facing the enemy and walking towards them)
- Use Q while mounting Skaarl, to get some distance, to maximize cooldown use and damage output.

Mounted | Skaarl Form
- Always use Q if target is in range and is a valid target (No immune/dead/untargetable etc)
[E] Jousting/Dash Logic
- Checks if target has the trap debuff, and if target is a melee/ranged target. (If ranged instantly use E, else wait for Q to trigger)
Also checks if target is killable with a simple E+AA combo, thus ignoring above logic.
- Upon hitting an enemy with Jousting [E] you are able to reuse E on said target. The logic for this is that it will use the second [E] only if the target is out of AA range or if the duration has almost expired.
